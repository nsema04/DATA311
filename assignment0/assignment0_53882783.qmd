# Introduction

Hello, my name is **Noah Semashkewich**. I am a **third** year student at **the University of British Columbia**. I am currently taking a Bachelor of Science with a major in *computer science*, and a minor in *data science*. I love to learn about computers and learn how to build new project all the time.

My favorite hobbies include **playing** and **creating** video games, listening to a wide variety of music and **collecting records**, as well as **hiking and exploring outdoors**.

## Data Wrangling

```{r}
setwd("~/DATA311/assignment0")
sales = read.csv("sales_data.csv")

#6. Displaying first few rows of the data
head(sales)
# Displaying data structure
str(sales)

#7. Removing duplicate rows from the dataset
unique(sales)

#8. Checking for missing values (none)
which(is.na(sales))

#9. Filtering dataset to display only sales made in New York
sales_ny = sales[sales$Store.Location == "New York", ]
sales_ny

#10. Filtering data to find the date when highest total was recorded
sales_by_date = aggregate(Total.Sales ~ Date, data = sales_ny, sum)
max_sale_date = sales_by_date[which.max(sales_by_date$Total.Sales), ]
max_sale_date

#11. Determining most frequently used payment method by customers
pm_count = table(sales_ny$Payment.Method)
most_frequent_pm = names(pm_count)[which.max(pm_count)]
most_frequent_pm
```

## Data Visualization

```{r fig.width=5, fig.height=6}
#12. Histogram of Customer Age
hist(sales$Customer.Age,
     main = "Histogram of Customer Age",
     xlab = "Customer Age",
     col = "lightblue",
     border = "black",
     las = 1)
```

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter-plot
#| fig-cap: "Scatter plot of the relationship between Quantity Sold and Price"
#13. Scatter plot of Quantity Sold and Price 
plot(sales$Quantity.Sold, sales$Price,
     xlab = "Quantity Sold",
     ylab = "Price",
     main = "Relationship between Quantity Sold and Price",
     pch = 19,
     col = "blue")
```

#14. Analysis of the relationship between quantity sold and price

Based on the scatter plot, we can observe the following characteristics between price and quantity sold.

-   Trend: There is no clear linear trend between price and quantity sold. The plot shows a varied distribution of data points without a consistent upward or downward pattern. This suggests changes in prices to not consistently affect quantity sold.

-   Clusters: The data points are distributed across a range of prices and quantities sold. Products with lower prices have a higher range of quantities sold, while high-priced items show lower quantities sold.

-   Outliters: There are several outliers where high priced items are sold in relatively small quantities. These outliers may represent conditions affecting sales.

In summary, the scatter plot @fig-scatter-plot shows that while there is some variability, there is no strong correlation of a relationship between quantity sold and price.
